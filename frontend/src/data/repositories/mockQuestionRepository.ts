        description: `
### Problem

Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters \`s\`. You must do this by modifying the input array **in-place** with O(1) extra memory.

### Instructions

- Reverse the characters in the array in-place.
- Do not allocate extra space for another array.

### Example

**Input:**
\`\`\`text
s = ["h", "e", "l", "l", "o"]
\`\`\`

**Output:**
\`\`\`text
["o", "l", "l", "e", "h"]
\`\`\`

### Constraints

- 1 <= \`s.length\` <= 10^5
- \`s[i]\` is a printable ASCII character.

### Problem

Implement a function to detect if a linked list contains a cycle.

![Linked List Cycle](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/07/circularlinkedlist.png)

### Instructions

- Given a linked list, determine if it has a cycle in it.
- Can you solve it using O(1) memory?

### Example

**Input:**
\`\`\`
head = [3, 2, 0, -4], pos = 1 (indicating tail connects to node index 1)
\`\`\`

**Output:**
\`\`\`
true
\`\`\`

### Constraints

- The number of nodes in the list is in the range [0, 10^4].
- \`-10^5 <= Node.val <= 10^5\`.
